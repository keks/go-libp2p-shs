> Implements [Dominic Tarr]'s secret handshake as well as the encrypted box stream.

The state of this package is work in progress. The package's interface might change, but the goal is to implement most of the interfaces of `github.com/multiformats/go-multiaddr-net` as well as `github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-transport`.
